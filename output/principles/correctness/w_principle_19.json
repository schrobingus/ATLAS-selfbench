If \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) represent the tens and units digits of this product, respectively, what is the value of \\( a + b \\)?\"\n \n **Solution**: 1. **Identify Relevant Digits**: We only need the tens and units digits of each number. For 834,209, these are 0 and 9. For 48,732, they are 3 and 2.\n 2. **Calculate Units Digit of Product**: Multiply the units digits: 9 * 2 = 18. The units digit of the product is 8.\n 3. **Calculate Tens Digit of Product**: Multiply each tens digit by the other number's units digit and add them: (9 * 3) + (0 * 2) = 27. Add the carry-over from the units digit calculation: 27 + 1 = 28.
