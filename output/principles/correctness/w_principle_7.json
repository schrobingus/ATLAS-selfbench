        "value": "Example 1**: \"Consider the product of two large numbers, 834,209 * 48,732. If \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) represent the tens and units digits of this product, respectively, what is the value of \\( a + b \\)?\"\n **Solution**: To find the tens and unit digits of the product, we only need to consider the tens and unit digits of 834,209 (which are 0 and 9) and 48,732 (which are 3 and 2). The product of 9 and 2 gives 18, which means the unit digit of the entire product is 8. To find the tens digit, we multiply the tens digit of one number with the unit digit of the other and add the product of the unit digits of both numbers, accounting for any carry-over. So, (9 * 3) + (0 * 2) + 1 (carry-over from 9 * 2) = 28. The tens digit is 8. Thus, \\( a + b = 8 + 8 = 16 \\).\n \n Example 2**: \"If \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are the tens and units digits, respectively, of the product 561,987 * 32,145, what is the value of \\( p + q \\)?\"\n \n **Solution**: Focus on the tens and units digits of 561,987 (which are 8 and 7) and 32,145 (which are 4 and 5). The product of 7 and 5 gives 35, meaning the unit digit of the entire product is 5. For the tens digit, we calculate (7 * 4) + (8 * 5) + 3 (carry-over from 7 * 5) = 63. The tens digit is 3. Therefore, \\( p + q = 3 + 5 = 8 \\).\n \n \n Question: If x and y are the tens digit and the units digit, respectively, of the product 725,278 * 67,066, what is the value of x + y? Explain the easiest solution without calculating the whole number."

During DNA replication, each original strand serves as a template for a new strand. Since only the original guanine was radioactive, only the strands that include the original DNA (one strand in each new double helix) will contain radioactive guanine.\n \n ### Example 2: If you replaced the adenine in a double helix with radioactive adenine and allowed DNA replication to occur once, what would you expect?\n - A: Neither of the double helices would contain radioactive adenine.\n - B: Both of the double helices would contain radioactive adenine.\n - C: Only one of the double helices would contain radioactive adenine.\n - D: The mRNA synthesized from the double helices would be radioactive, but the DNA would not.\n \n **Solution**: The correct answer is C: Only one of the double helices would contain radioactive adenine. In DNA replication, each strand of the original double helix separates and serves as a template for a new strand. The new strands are synthesized from non-radioactive nucleotides, so only the original strands, which include the radioactive adenine, will be radioactive.
