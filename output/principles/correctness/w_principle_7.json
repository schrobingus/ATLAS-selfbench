If \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) represent the tens and units digits of this product, respectively, what is the value of \\( a + b \\)?\"\n **Solution**: To find the tens and unit digits of the product, we only need to consider the tens and unit digits of 834,209 (which are 0 and 9) and 48,732 (which are 3 and 2).

Since only the original guanine was radioactive, only the strands that include the original DNA (one strand in each new double helix) will contain radioactive guanine.\n \n ### Example 2: If you replaced the adenine in a double helix with radioactive adenine and allowed DNA replication to occur once, what would you expect?\n - A: Neither of the double helices would contain radioactive adenine.\n - B: Both of the double helices would contain radioactive adenine.\n - C: Only one of the double helices would contain radioactive adenine.\n - D: The mRNA synthesized from the double helices would be radioactive, but the DNA would not.\n \n **Solution**: The correct answer is C: Only one of the double helices would contain radioactive adenine. In DNA replication, each strand of the original double helix separates and serves as a template for a new strand. The new strands are synthesized from non-radioactive nucleotides, so only the original strands, which include the radioactive adenine, will be radioactive. Thus, each new double helix will have one radioactive and one non-radioactive strand.\n \n \n \n Question: If you replaced the thymine in a double helix with radioactive thymine and you allowed DNA replication to occur once, which of the following results would you expect? Choices: A: The DNA would not be radioactive in either of the double helices. B: The mRNA made from the double helices would be radioactive. C: The DNA in each of the double helices would be radioactive. D: The DNA in one of the double helices would be radioactive but not in the other one"

Social cost: $300 (cost) - $200 (value) = $100.\n \n \n Question: In a country where everyone is identical, 100 people wait in line each day to buy raspberries at a controlled price. The government has decided to hand out free coffee to the people standing in line. The coffee costs the government $1 per cup, but the people in line value that coffee at only 75 cents per cup.

The faces of the cards are 3, 8, red, and yellow. Which cards would you have to turn to test the truth of the proposition that if a card shows an even number on one face, then the opposite face is red?"
